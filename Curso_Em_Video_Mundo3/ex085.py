#CHALLENGE 85: Evens and odds in nested lists
#GOAL:Write code that receives 7 positive integers and separate them in two lists (one of even numbers, and another of odds) that are both
#nested inside of a main list. Then, print out those two sub lists in order
#SKILL: Learning about nested lists

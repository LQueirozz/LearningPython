#CHALLENGE 3: Adding two numbers
#GOAL: Write code that receives two integers and prints out the sum between them
#SKILL: Learning about operators and basic data types

n1 = int( input('Type in an integer: '))
n2 = int( input('Type in one more integer: '))
s1= n1+n2
print(f'The sum between {n1} and {n2} is {s1}')

# LearningPython

This repository is meant to store my progress as I follow along an introductory course of Python3 made by the "Curso Em VÃ­deo" youtube channel. Their lesson plan is divided among three "worlds" of learning, which is the name given to the sections present. 
Each world had about 35 exercises in order to help the viewers better absorb the lessons.

## Content:
* World 1/ Fundamentals (Mundo 1, in portuguese)
* World 2/ Control structures (Mundo 2)
* World 3/ Data structures (Mundo 3)
